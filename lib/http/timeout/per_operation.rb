          # the x seconds. In a normal case this would be a timeout on wait/read, but it can
          # also mean that the socket has been closed by the server. Therefore we "mark" the
          # socket for timeout and try to read more bytes. If it returns :eof, it's all good, no
          # timeout. Else, the first timeout was a proper timeout.
          # This hack has to be done because io/wait#wait_readable doesn't provide a value for when
          # the socket is closed by the server, and HTTP::Parser doesn't provide the limit for the chunks.
