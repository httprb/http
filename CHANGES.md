* Reflect FormData rename changes (FormData -> HTTP::FormData). ([@ixti])
* [#173](https://github.com/httprb/http/pull/173):
  `HTTP::Headers` now raises `HTTP::InvalidHeaderNameError` in case of
  (surprise) invalid HTTP header field name (e.g.`"Foo:Bar"`). ([@ixti])


## 0.7.3 (2015-03-24)

* SECURITY FIX: http.rb failed to call the `#post_connection_check` method on
  SSL connections. This method implements hostname verification, and without it
  `http.rb` was vulnerable to MitM attacks. The problem was corrected by calling
  `#post_connection_check` (CVE-2015-1828) ([@zanker])


## 0.7.2 (2015-03-02)

* Swap from `form_data` to `http-form_data` (changed gem name).


## 0.7.1 (2015-01-03)

* Gemspec fixups
* Remove superfluous space in HTTP::Response inspection


## 0.7.0 (2015-01-02)

* [#73](https://github.com/httprb/http/issues/73),
  [#167](https://github.com/httprb/http/pull/167):

* Fix URI path normalization: `https://github.com` -> `https://github.com/`.
  ([@ixti])
* [#163](https://github.com/httprb/http/pull/163),
  [#166](https://github.com/httprb/http/pull/166),
  [#152](https://github.com/httprb/http/issues/152):
  Fix handling of EOF which caused infinite loop. ([@mickm], [@ixti])
* Drop Ruby 1.8.7 support. ([@ixti])
* [#150](https://github.com/httprb/http/issues/150):
  Fix default Host header value. ([@ixti])
* Remove BearerToken authorization header. ([@ixti])
* `#auth` sugar now accepts only string value of Authorization header.
  Calling `#auth(:basic, opts)` is deprecated, use `#basic_auth(opts)` instead.
  ([@ixti])
* Fix handling of chunked responses without Content-Length header. ([@ixti])
* Remove `HTTP::Request#method` and deprecate `HTTP::Request#__method__`
  ([@sferik])
* Deprecate `HTTP::Response::STATUS_CODES`,
  use `HTTP::Response::Status::REASONS` instead ([@ixti])
* Deprecate `HTTP::Response::SYMBOL_TO_STATUS_CODE` ([@ixti])
* Deprecate `HTTP::Response#status_code` ([@ixti])
* `HTTP::Response#status` now returns `HTTP::Response::Status`. ([@ixti])
* `HTTP::Response#reason` and `HTTP::Response#code` are proxies them
  to corresponding methods of `HTTP::Response#status` ([@ixti])
* Rename `HTTP.with_follow` to `HTTP.follow` and mark former one as being
  deprecated ([@ixti])
* Delegate `HTTP::Response#readpartial` to `HTTP::Response::Body` ([@ixti])


## 0.6.4 (2015-03-25)

* SECURITY FIX: http.rb failed to call the `#post_connection_check` method on
  SSL connections. This method implements hostname verification, and without it
  `http.rb` was vulnerable to MitM attacks. The problem was corrected by calling
  `#post_connection_check` (CVE-2015-1828) ([@zanker], backported by [@nicoolas25])


## 0.6.3 (2014-11-14)

* [#166](https://github.com/httprb/http/pull/166):
  Backported EOF fix from master branch. ([@ixti])

``` ruby
# Main API change you will mention is that `request` method and it's
# syntax sugar helpers like `get`, `post`, etc. now returns Response
# object instead of BodyDelegator:

response = HTTP.get "http://example.com"
raw_body = HTTP.get("http://example.com").to_s
parsed_body = HTTP.get("http://example.com/users.json").parse

# Second major change in API is work with request/response headers
# It is now delegated to `HTTP::Headers` class, so you can check it's
# documentation for details, here we will only outline main difference.
# Duckface (`=`) does not appends headers anymore

request[:content_type] = "text/plain"
request[:content_type] = "text/html"
request[:content_type] # => "text/html"

# In order to add multiple header values, you should pass array:

request[:cookie] = ["foo=bar", "woo=hoo"]
request[:cookie] # => ["foo=bar", "woo=hoo"]

# or call `#add` on headers:

request.headers.add :accept, "text/plain"
request.headers.add :accept, "text/html"
request[:accept] # => ["text/plain", "text/html"]

# Also, you can now read body in chunks (stream):

res = HTTP.get "http://example.com"
File.open "/tmp/dummy.bin", "wb" do |io|
  while (chunk = res.readpartial)
    io << chunk
  end
end
```
