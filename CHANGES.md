``` ruby
# Main API change you will mention is that `request` method and it's
# syntax sugar helpers like `get`, `post`, etc. now returns Response
# object instead of BodyDelegator:

response = HTTP.get "http://example.com"
raw_body = HTTP.get("http://example.com").to_s
parsed_body = HTTP.get("http://example.com/users.json").parse

# Second major change in API is work with request/response headers
# It is now delegated to `HTTP::Headers` class, so you can check it's
# documentation for details, here we will only outline main difference.
# Duckface (`=`) does not appends headers anymore

request[:content_type] = "text/plain"
request[:content_type] = "text/html"
request[:content_type] # => "text/html"

# In order to add multiple header values, you should pass array:

request[:cookie] = ["foo=bar", "woo=hoo"]
request[:cookie] # => ["foo=bar", "woo=hoo"]

# or call `#add` on headers:

request.headers.add :accept, "text/plain"
request.headers.add :accept, "text/html"
request[:accept] # => ["text/plain", "text/html"]

# Also, you can now read body in chunks (stream):

res = HTTP.get "http://example.com"
File.open "/tmp/dummy.bin", "wb" do |io|
  while (chunk = res.readpartial)
    io << chunk
  end
end
```
