About
-----

http.rb is an easy-to-use client library for making requests from Ruby. It uses
a simple method chaining system for building requests, similar to Python's [Requests].

Under the hood, http.rb uses [http_parser.rb], a fast HTTP parsing native
extension based on the Node.js parser and a Java port thereof. This library
isn't just yet another wrapper around Net::HTTP. It implements the HTTP protocol
natively and outsources the parsing to native extensions.

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'http'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install http

Inside of your Ruby program do:

    require 'http'

...to pull it in as a dependency.

Documentation
-------------

[Please see the http.rb wiki](https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/wiki)
for more detailed documentation and usage notes.

Basic Usage
-----------

Here's some simple examples to get you started:

### GET requests

```ruby
>> HTTP.get('https://github.com').to_s
=> "<html><head><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=..."
```

That's all it takes! To obtain an `HTTP::Response` object instead of the response
body, all we have to do is omit the #to_s on the end:

```ruby
>> HTTP.get('https://github.com')
=> #<HTTP/1.0 200 OK @headers={"Content-Type"=>"text/html; charset=UTF-8", "Date"=>"Fri, ...>
 => #<HTTP::Response/1.1 200 OK @headers={"Content-Type"=>"text/html; ...>
```

We can also obtain an `HTTP::Response::Body` object for this response:

```ruby
>> HTTP.get('https://github.com').body
 => #<HTTP::Response::Body:814d7aac @streaming=false>
```

The response body can be streamed with `HTTP::Response::Body#readpartial`:

```ruby
>> HTTP.get('https://github.com').body.readpartial
 => "<!doctype html><html "
```

In practice you'll want to bind the HTTP::Response::Body to a local variable (e.g.
"body") and call readpartial on it repeatedly until it returns nil.

### POST requests

Making POST requests is simple too. Want to POST a form?

```ruby
HTTP.post('http://example.com/resource', :form => {:foo => '42'})
```
Making GET requests with query string parameters is as simple.

```ruby
HTTP.get('http://example.com/resource', :params => {:foo => 'bar'})
```

Want to POST with a specific body, JSON for instance?

```ruby
HTTP.post('http://example.com/resource', :json => { :foo => '42' })
```

Or just a plain body?

```ruby
HTTP.post('http://example.com/resource', :body => 'foo=42&bar=baz')
```

Posting a file?

``` ruby
HTTP.post('http://examplc.com/resource', :form => {
  :username => 'ixti',
  :avatar   => HTTP::FormData::File.new('/home/ixit/avatar.png')
})
```

It's easy!

### Proxy Support

Making request behind proxy is as simple as making them directly. Just specify
hostname (or IP address) of your proxy server and its port, and here you go:

```ruby
HTTP.via('proxy-hostname.local', 8080)
  .get('http://example.com/resource')
```

Proxy needs authentication? No problem:

```ruby
HTTP.via('proxy-hostname.local', 8080, 'username', 'password')
  .get('http://example.com/resource')
```

### Adding Headers

The HTTP gem uses the concept of chaining to simplify requests. Let's say
you want to get the latest commit of this library from GitHub in JSON format.
One way we could do this is by tacking a filename on the end of the URL:

```ruby
HTTP.get('https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/commit/HEAD.json')
```

The GitHub API happens to support this approach, but really this is a bit of a
hack that makes it easy for people typing URLs into the address bars of
browsers to perform the act of content negotiation. Since we have access to
the full, raw power of HTTP, we can perform content negotiation the way HTTP
intends us to, by using the Accept header:

```ruby
HTTP.with_headers(:accept => 'application/json').
  get('https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/commit/HEAD')
```

This requests JSON from GitHub. GitHub is smart enough to understand our
request and returns a response with Content-Type: application/json.

Shorter aliases exists for HTTP.with_headers:

```ruby
HTTP.with(:accept => 'application/json').
  get('https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/commit/HEAD')

HTTP[:accept => 'application/json'].
  get('https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/commit/HEAD')
```

### Authorization Header

With [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) using
a username and password:

```ruby
HTTP.basic_auth(:user => 'user', :pass => 'pass')
# <HTTP::Headers {"Authorization"=>"Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz"}>
```

Or with plain as-is value:

```ruby
HTTP.auth('Bearer VGhlIEhUVFAgR2VtLCBST0NLUw')
# <HTTP::Headers {"Authorization"=>"Bearer VGhlIEhUVFAgR2VtLCBST0NLUw"}>
```

And Chain all together!

```ruby
HTTP.basic_auth(:user => 'user', :pass => 'pass')
  .with('Cookie' => '9wq3w')
  .get('https://example.com')
```

### Content Negotiation

As important a concept as content negotiation is to HTTP, it sure should be easy,
right? But usually it's not, and so we end up adding ".json" onto the ends of
our URLs because the existing mechanisms make it too hard. It should be easy:

```ruby
HTTP.accept(:json).get('https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/commit/HEAD')
```

This adds the appropriate Accept header for retrieving a JSON response for the
given resource.

### Celluloid::IO Support

http.rb makes it simple to make multiple concurrent HTTP requests from a
Celluloid::IO actor. Here's a parallel HTTP fetcher combining http.rb with
Celluloid::IO:

```ruby
require 'celluloid/io'
require 'http'

class HttpFetcher
  include Celluloid::IO

  def fetch(url)
    HTTP.get(url, socket_class: Celluloid::IO::TCPSocket)
  end
end
```

There's a little more to it, but that's the core idea!

* [Full parallel HTTP fetcher example](https://github.com/httprb/http.rb/wiki/Parallel-requests-with-Celluloid%3A%3AIO)
* See also: [Celluloid::IO](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io)

### Caching

http.rb provides caching of HTTP request (per
[RFC 7234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234)) when configured to do
so.

```ruby
require 'http'

http = HTTP.with_cache(metastore:   "file:/var/cache/my-app-http/meta",
                       entitystore: "file:/var/cache/my-app-http/entity")

http.get("http://example.com/")   # makes request
http.get("http://example.com/")   # skips making request and returns
                                  # previously cached response
```

http.rb's caching is backed by
[rack-cache's excellent storage subsystem](http://rtomayko.github.io/rack-cache/storage.html). Any
storage URL supported by rack-cache is supported by http.rb's cache.

Supported Ruby Versions
-----------------------

This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
versions:

* Ruby 1.9.3
* Ruby 2.0.0
* Ruby 2.1.x
* Ruby 2.2.x

If something doesn't work on one of these versions, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby versions,
however support will only be provided for the versions listed above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version or
implementation, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer
entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When
something breaks on your implementation, you will be responsible for providing
patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation
exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be
dropped.
